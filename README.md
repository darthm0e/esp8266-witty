# ESP8266 WittyCloud Board with WS2812B

Just a small Test to controll a WS2812B over WiFi with an ESP8266 WittyCloud Board
Got some off them lying around and a friend needs a new AmbiLight with wifi feature ;)

This is just an early PoC.
Feel free to use it in your own projects, but respect the other sources Licenses
